# This is a version of the classic Tetris written in Go for educational purpose (to limit the number of concepts, we may deviate from idiomatic Go at times). #
To build it from source and run it on your machine, you need to install :
1) Git https://git-scm.com/downloads
2) Visual Studio Code (or any editor/IDE or you choice) https://code.visualstudio.com/download if you want to change the code
3) Go https://golang.org/dl/

Then, you need to get the source code by running the command 
    git clone https://github.com/algosup/gotris.git 
in a terminal.
To run the code, move to the gotris folder:
    cd gotris
Then run
    go run .
